# CurrencyAPI

A currency API created as part of a university assignment made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, PHP and XML (inc. a schema). The assignment guidelines in short were to:

* Create an XML file which contains all the currency rates and an XSD file to validate it.
* Automatically update the rates within the XML file if they havent been done so in the past 12 hours.
* Use any server-side language of my chosing (i used PHP) to create an API which can convert currency and return in either XML or JSON format (depending on what is selected in the front end).
* Handle full CRUD operations on the rates XML files and respond to successful operations with XML or JSON format (depending on what is selected in the front end).
* Create a front-end using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to show it working.
* Use XPath where necessary.
* Create and manage custom and predefined (by the tutor) error codes and send when necessary.
* Create a configuration file to manage the errors and more (i used as much as possible).

These are not the exact guidelines but it was very similar to this and I was rewarded 93% as a result. I went further and used OOP and design patterns to improve upon my own knowledge and skills. I probably did more than I needed to, but I'm glad I did and I am proud of the results.
